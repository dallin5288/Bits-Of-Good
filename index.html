                        Hello! My name is Dallin, a third-year computer science student from Bowling Green, Kentucky. 
                        I have a strong passion for using technology to make a positive social impact, 
                        especially through projects that bridge the gap between people and the tools they need. 
                        Besides my academic pursuits, dddddddddddddI enjoy fishing and camping, which allow me to connect with nature 
                        and unwind from the busy world of technology.
                    </p>
